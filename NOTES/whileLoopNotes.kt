// WHILE LOOPS IN KOTLIN

/*
    Basically the same in C#

    The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

WHILE LOOP:
    The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

var i = 0
while (i < 5) {
  println(i)
  i++
} // displays 0 1 2 3 4


DO WHILE LOOP:
The do..while loop is a variant of the while loop.
This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true,
then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

var i = 0
do {
  println(i)
  i++
  }
while (i < 5) // displays 0 1 2 3 4

NOTE: Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!
